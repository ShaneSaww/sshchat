# sshchat
Custom made chat server that runs over SSH.    
I did this to learn about channels, and trying to make something lightweight and concurrent in GO.


## TODO:
Lots! I want to make the chat input cleaner, and there are some visual bugs with the terminal that gets setup in GO.   
I want the ability to run multiple chat rooms out of a single server.
